# Toy-Problems

These algorithms are sourced from various websites online that provide a range of algorithm challenges that can be solved using any programming language of choice. The ones in this repo are all solved to their completeness in JavaScript. Each toy problem contains its own tests, an explanation of its input and expected output, followed by its solution.

Some of the websites that reference to these algorithms are:

www.coderbyte.com (They have since switched to a subscription model)

www.w3schools.com (The JS challenges page)
